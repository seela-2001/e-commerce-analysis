    <Title>E-Commerce Customer & Sales Analysis Using Apache Spark</Title>
  </ProjectInfo>

  <Abstract>
    This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset using Apache Spark (PySpark) to extract valuable insights such as total revenue, best-selling products, top customers, sales by country, and average basket value. Spark was used due to its high performance and ability to process large datasets efficiently.
  </Abstract>

  <Dataset>
    <FileName>online_retail.csv</FileName>
    <Description>
      The dataset contains transaction records from an online retail store with the following columns:
      InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
    </Description>
    <RecordsNote>Enter number of records after loading the dataset</RecordsNote>
    <Preprocessing>
      <Step>Removed rows with missing critical values.</Step>
      <Step>Filtered out records with non-positive Quantity or UnitPrice.</Step>
      <Step>Created a new column TotalPrice = Quantity * UnitPrice.</Step>
    </Preprocessing>
  </Dataset>
